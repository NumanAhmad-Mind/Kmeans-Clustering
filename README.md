# Kmeans-Clustering
K-means clustering is a method which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.  Implementing k-means clustering on a randomly generated dataset from scratch. Hierarchical clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to cluster unlabeled data points. Like K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering also groups together the data points with similar characteristics. There are two types of hierarchical clustering algorithms:  Agglomerative — Bottom up approach. Start with many small clusters and merge them together to create bigger clusters. Divisive — Top down approach. Start with a single cluster than break it up into smaller clusters.
